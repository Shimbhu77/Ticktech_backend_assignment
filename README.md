# PHP API Integration

This simple PHP application fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays it on a web page. The fetched data is a collection of posts with titles and bodies. The PHP code uses cURL to make a GET request to the API endpoint and retrieves the JSON response.

## How to Run the Application

1. Make sure you have PHP installed on your system.
2. Access the PHP application by opening the `index.php` file in a web browser. If you are using a local server environment, access it using the server's URL (e.g., [localhost](http://localhost/firstphp/) ).

## Features
